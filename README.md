# Welcome to my world 👋

I'm Kevin, a french developer. I have been working for the last ten years for different countries around the world. With my experience, I become an expert in PHP and JavaScript. You can ask me almost anything about NodeJS, React, WordPress.

### A bit of my life

My journey started in Thailand with **Supersogo Co. LTD**  as a *frontend developer*. A web company based in Bangkok who taught me a lot about newsletter, wordpress and design in general. This experience improved my level with PHP, ruby and rail and javascript. It was very interesting. 

After, I moved back in France and work for **ID Interactive** as a *frontend developer*. An other web company based in Vannes. This time, I learnt a lot about prestashop, react, SEO and again wordpress, javascript. 

And finally, I moved in Philippines and actually work for **Rumarocket** as a *backend developer and System administrator*. Rumarocket is a IA company based in Manila.
